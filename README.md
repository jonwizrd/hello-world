# hello-world
Just another repository

My goal is to learn Github's workflow. 

1. Create branch off of master
2. Make some edits and commit changes.
3. Open a Pull Request when ready
4. Once reviewed, merge the changes into master branch.

Forked hello-world repo, making some changes for trying pull request.
